Hello,

  I am a mechanical engineer who started working after getting his bachelor's degree without knowing any programming. I enjoy learning new things and noticed that learning how to program could satisfy that while improving my efficiency at work.

  I started on the Matlab journey originally, but quickly abandoned it in favor of Python after numerous recommendations from friends and collegaues. (The fact that the company that I currently work for does not use Matlab also had a big impact there.) I'm learning in my 'spare time', so it may be rather slow. I've found that following along on some generic 'Learn Python' type of tutorial was not keeping me motivated, so I've been trying to stick to projects that interest me (see my throttle-by-wire project for example), or that can be helpful at work.

  I'm currently (Jan of 2022) going back to school for my master's degree, and have just enrolled in a course that requires Matlab & Simulink, so I may shift gears here soon to focus on that.  Another language that I anticipate wanting to learn more about is yaml since it is used in home automation often.
  
  As always, any constructive criticism is welcome.
